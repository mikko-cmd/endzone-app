Fantasy Implications for Coaching Moves This Offseason
Head CoachBen Johnson
Ben Johnson, CHI
He was the prized coaching hire of the off-season, and it seems like Chicago is already making strides in a ton of areas. They bolstered the interior of the offensive line in free agency, hopefully able to fix the highest pressure-to-sack ratio in the NFL. During his three years as OC in Detroit, Johnson’s offenses had the three highest 4th down go %s of any team since 2016. We expect this offense to take a massive step forward in 2025.

Head CoachBrian Schottenheimer
Brian Schottenheimer, DAL
Is there anyone who has more admiration for a good visor? Jerry Jones stayed in-house, promoting Schottenheimer from offensive coordinator to head coach. It was a very Dallas move after the offense ranked in the bottom 5 in both EPA per pass and rush last year. This team feels like it’s at a crossroads for staying competitive alongside Philadelphia and Washington in the NFC East.

Head CoachLiam Coen
Liam Coen, JAX
Say it with us: Duuuuuuuuuvallllllll! Yes, there is enough cringe for the whole world to experience during Coen’s press conferences, but you can’t argue with the massive success he had with Tampa Bay last year. He’s spoken highly of concentrating the offense through Brian Thomas Jr., we love some Travis Hunter, and perhaps we can finally see what Trevor Lawrence can do with some innovative play-calling. Maybe? Things are looking up for the Jaguars!

Head CoachPete Carroll
Pete Carroll, LV
When Carroll turns 74 in September, he will become the oldest head coach in NFL history. The former Seattle Seahawks legend returns to the NFL after a one year hiatus and reunites with QB Geno Smith. For being such an old man, the energy surrounding this hire and some of the pieces Las Vegas has in place does make you consider that the Raiders could surprise in 2025.

Head CoachMike Vrabel
Mike Vrabel, NE
We all knew it was coming. After a failed one year experiment with Jerod Mayo, the Patriots went back to the “greatest hits” album, inking the former 3-time Patriots Super Bowl Champion linebacker. Vrabel’s teams were uber-competitive during his six years in Tennessee but this Patriots team (especially the offense) has room for improvement. Expect the organization to be a bit more patient.

Head CoachKellen Moore
Kellen Moore, NO
Coming off a Super Bowl win, it was inevitable that Moore would parlay his Eagles success into a head coaching job. His emphasis on slot receivers and opening the offense should help a Saints offense that was basically running replacement players out there towards the end of the season. The question remains if rookie Tyler Shough is the answer at QB or if New Orleans is just burying their heads in the sand for another year?

Head CoachAaron Glenn
Aaron Glenn, NYJ
Consider this a win for the Jets on an organizational level. Glenn’s no-nonsense approach represents a new course of direction after the last two years were known more for the off-the-field hullabaloo with Aaron Rodgers than the product on the field. He rightly represents the identity of a team that wants to win with defense, and yet we still have giant questions about the functionality of the offense with Justin Fields under center.

Offensive CoordinatorDeclan Doyle
Declan Doyle, CHI
After spending the past two years under Sean Payton, Doyle’s job will be teaming up with Ben Johnson to make QB Caleb Williams’ sophomore season a success. Alliteration aside, Doyle will be a breath of fresh air from the stench laid by Shane Waldron last year.

Offensive CoordinatorKlayton Adams
Klayton Adams, DAL
The former Cardinals offensive line coach will be tasked with revamping the Dallas running game after ranking 27th in rushing yards per game. Newly crowned HC Brian Schottenheimer will remain the play-caller.

Offensive CoordinatorGrant Udinksi
Grant Udinksi, JAX
What were you doing at age 29? Udinski was an up-and-coming name in Kevin O’Connell’s regime as an assistant OC and QB coach. He’ll essentially be play-designing and clipboard-holding for Liam Coen for a Jaguars team coming off a 4-win season.

Offensive CoordinatorChip Kelly
Chip Kelly, LV
After winning a National Title at Ohio State last year, the former Eagles and 49ers head coach is back in the NFL. He’s claimed that the Raiders offense will look different than his previous “up-tempo” NFL stints. The running game needs a major overhaul after totaling the lowest expected points added (EPA) per rush attempt of any NFL team over the last five years.

Offensive CoordinatorJosh McDaniels
Josh McDaniels, NE
Wait, haven’t we seen this movie before? This is now McDaniels’ third separate stint in New England as old buddy Mike Vrabel decided to extend an olive branch to his NFL coaching career. This might be his toughest test yet as the Patriots had the fewest plays of 15+ yards in the NFL with an offensive line that used 13 different OL starters, tied for the 2nd most of any team since 1999.

Offensive CoordinatorDoug Nussmeier
Doug Nussmeier, NO
Whether you know him as Nussmeier or Dougie Fresh, call him the Samwise to Kellen Moore’s Frodo. They’ve been together at all three of Moore’s stops (DAL, LAC, PHI) along their NFL journey, and Moore will continue to call plays.

Offensive CoordinatorTanner Engstrand
Tanner Engstrand, NYJ
After spending the last five years in Detroit as an offensive assistant and passing game coordinator, Engstrand joins Aaron Glenn in New York. The Aaron Rodgers era is over, but the overall offensive stench remains. The Jets were dead last in plays inside the five over the last two years. If Engstrand resurrects Justin Fields’ NFL career, it will be a work of art.

Offensive CoordinatorTommy Rees
Tommy Rees, CLE
The former Notre Dame QB was promoted from passing game specialist to OC. The Browns trailed on 73% of their offensive plays last year so their insane pass rate and dreadful yards per attempt (5.3) makes a ton of sense. This team is in flux so apart from some magic at the QB position, it’s hard being bullish on the Browns offense in 2025.

Offensive CoordinatorJohn Morton
John Morton, DET
A former Jets OC way back in 2017, Morton was in Detroit in 2022 with Dan Campbell before being the Denver passing game coordinator the last two years under Sean Payton. The Lions offense was near perfection last year, ranking #1 in points per game and 2nd in yards per game. While this is as talented a bunch as there is in the NFL, Ben Johnson’s play-calling prowess will be missed.

Offensive CoordinatorNick Caley
Nick Caley, HOU
It seems like HC DeMeco Ryans had enough of Bobby Slowik’s anemic offense down the stretch. Despite winning the AFC South and two straight years of wild card playoff wins, Caley was brought in to redirect the ship. C.J. Stroud will need some protection after seeing a league-high 235 pressures last year. Caley’s experience is as a TE coach in New England for years before dousing himself in the “cologne d’McVay” the last two years in LA.

Offensive CoordinatorKevin Patullo
Kevin Patullo, PHI
Nick Sirianni becomes the first head coach to have four different OCs in a 4-season span for one team. Patullo was the passing game coordinator since 2021 and was with Sirianni during his time in Indianapolis. Coming off a Super Bowl win, we don’t have much concern despite Kellen Moore leaving.

Offensive CoordinatorKlay Kubiak
Klay Kubiak, SF
“Little baby Kubes” is named the San Fran OC after the 49ers hadn’t officially named anyone to the position since Mike McDaniel’s exodus following the 2021 season. Kubiak has been in the organization for the last five years, but the play calling duties will remain in Kyle Shanahan’s grasp. The 49ers will need to fix some issues post-Deebo Samuel after failing to finish in the top-2 in YAC per reception for the first time in the last seven years.

Offensive CoordinatorKlint Kubiak
Klint Kubiak, SEA
It was clear HC Mike Macdonald was not too happy with his regime as OC Ryan Grubb was let go and the passing game received a massive makeover with Sam Darnold and Cooper Kupp now in tow. After going from 5th to 24th in turnovers last year, Macdonald wants to win with defense and ball control. Expect an emphasis on the running game and a commitment to use more 2TE sets and the occasional fullback.

Offensive CoordinatorJosh Grizzard
Josh Grizzard, TB
A new JGrizz has entered the chat. After spending seven years in Miami, Grizzard was the passing game coordinator last year under Liam Coen’s record-setting offense. With Coen now 200+ miles away in Jacksonville, the Grizz born in Lizard Lick, NC, steps in for an offense that should return every key piece from their incredible 2024 campaign.
